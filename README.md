# Stacks-Hello-World-Tutorial

A simple Hello World app for the Stacks community. Probably the only one that actually works.

The goal of this repository is to act as a resource to give green developers an instant 
start in development of Stacks apps.

### Requirements

- Docker
- NodeJS (vx.x.x) TBD
- Make

### Quickstart

```
make quickstart
```


## DIY - The steps I followed

First of all, I needed to create the project and hello-world contract with clarinet;

```
clarinet new .

clarinet contract new hello-world

```

Then I needed to write the smart contract.
